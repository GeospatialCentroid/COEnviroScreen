## Setting up the local environment

The data processing code is stored in the Geospatial Centroid's GitHub and needs to be downloaded or cloned to render in the local environment.
https://github.com/GeospatialCentroid/COEnviroScreen_dataProcessing

We've utilized a .rproj file to organize this work, and we recommend you do the same.

Open the R Project file with the repository on your local device and then the `0_main.R` file. Barring special use cases, all data connected to the EnviroScreen score and shiny applications can be generated through edits within this script alone.

### Input datasets

The input data sets for the EnviroScreen project are stored in the Geospatial Centroid's GitHub. Please download this content. The following section will describe how to bring it into the R project while maintaining all relative links.
